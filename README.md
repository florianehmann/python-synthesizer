# python-synthesizer
Basic Audio Synthesizer written in Python

## Testing

Invoke `pytest` with
```bash
(venv) $ python -m pytest
```
rather than just calling `pytest`. This is required to add the `synthesizer` module to the path.
Alternatively, add the project root directory to the `PYTHONPATH` variable.
